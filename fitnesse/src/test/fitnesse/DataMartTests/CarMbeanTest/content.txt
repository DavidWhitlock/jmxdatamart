There are a couple of FitNesse fixtures that manipulate MBeans.  These tests test those fixtures.

| Import |
| org.jmxdatamart.fixtures |

The CreateMBeans fixture creates a new MBean by invoking its zero-argument constructor and registers the MBean with the given name

!| create MBeans |
| bean class | bean name |
| org.jmxdatamart.SimpleMBean | org.jmxdatamart.fitnesse:type=SimpleMBean,forTest=CarMBean |

The ConfigureMBeans fixture sets attributes of MBeans

!| configure MBeans |
| bean name | attribute | value |
| org.jmxdatamart.fitnesse:type=SimpleMBean,forTest=CarMBean | IntAttribute | 42 |

The ValidateMBeans fixture tests to make sure that MBeans have the expected values
